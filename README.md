My name is Mete Namazov, and I'm from Azerbaijan. I'm currently a first-year Computer Engineering student at Bilkent University. In my school years, I had a great interest in informatics, which led me to win a silver and a bronze medal in the Republic-level Informatics Olympiad. I was also honored to participate twice in the National Informatics Olympiad Training Program, organized by the Ministry of Science and Education.
